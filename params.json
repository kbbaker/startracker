{"name":"Startracker","tagline":"","body":"### Startracker.\r\n\r\nStartracker (startracker.routeyou.com) is a digital ecosystem. It offers a way of interacting with the data you are willing to share about your movements (a tracked trip or planned route, the type of your trip, an activity) by mixing it up with available information along your trip. We rate your route based on our \"nicest-path algorithm\" and when we detect ‘conflicts’ along your route we summarize it in a status request (StaR). A StaR is always linked to a road segment along your route. For example, while analysing a race cycling route we detect that your route uses a road segment which is unpaved; this is a conflict between mode and terrain type.\r\n\r\nFollowing map shows some stars awaiting integration in Openstreetmap: \r\n\r\n<script src=\"https://embed.github.com/view/geojson/kbbaker/startracker/test.json\"></script>","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
